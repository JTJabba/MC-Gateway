need to add support to EarlyConnectionHandler to disconnect players with message after handshake and update test gateway to use if it fails getting logged in connection

look into writing packets to stream together for pre play state stuff

add logging for writepacket failing to compress

add clean logging for 'System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (111): Connection refused' when can't connect to backend server

add GatewayLogging.Config switch for troubleshooting early MCClientConnections

remove code in packet meant for reading from it directly (CursorPosition, stateful reading methods) and refactor reliant code

move common code from protocol versions to one namespace
