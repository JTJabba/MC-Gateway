HIGH PRIORITY

need to add support to EarlyConnectionHandler to disconnect players with message after handshake and update examples to use if it fails getting logged in connection

abstract memory-pooling logic away from Packet and remove its dispose logic

move stuff in MCClientConnection constructor to create method

LOW PRIORITY

update EasyConfig to have an IsLoaded property in ConfigLoader and remove hack in config validation

update EasyConfig to support config-defined namespaces and generate partial classes, and merge with GatewayConfig. Should consider scoping config

somehow scope config for components that might be used unconventionally (preferably whole gateway config shouldn't need to be loaded for someone to use MCClientConnection)

look into writing packets to stream together for pre play state stuff

add logging for writepacket failing to compress


PREP FOR MULTIVERSION MAGIC

move common code from protocol versions to one namespace

create one namespace to hold all unique MC[Clientbound/Serverbound]Connection types and one for all unique packet types, and make source generator that reads from compatibility map json and generates unified namespaces for connection and packet types for each version. Each unified version namespace will just be a bunch of references to the compatible implementations

remove code in Packet meant for reading from it directly (CursorPosition, stateful reading methods) and refactor reliant code
