HIGH PRIORITY

add PingPongReceiver and PingPongService demos to TestGateway

need to add support to EarlyConnectionHandler to disconnect players with message after handshake and update test gateway to use if it fails getting logged in connection

abstract memory-pooling logic away from Packet and remove its dispose logic

LOW PRIORITY

update EasyConfig to support config-defined namespaces so we can use it in Gateway dependees (like TestGateway, which needs EasyConfig)

look into writing packets to stream together for pre play state stuff

add logging for writepacket failing to compress

add clean logging for 'System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (111): Connection refused' when can't connect to backend server

add GatewayLogging.Config switch for troubleshooting early MCClientConnections


PREP FOR MULTIVERSION MAGIC

move common code from protocol versions to one namespace

create one namespace to hold all unique MC[Clientbound/Serverbound]Connection types and one for all unique packet types, and make source generator that reads from compatibility map json and generates unified namespaces for connection and packet types for each version. Each unified version namespace will just be a bunch of references to the compatible implementations

remove code in Packet meant for reading from it directly (CursorPosition, stateful reading methods) and refactor reliant code
